# movieInfoApp


## Synopsis

My movie App that allows a user to search for movies by title, and retrieve specific information by id - using the OMDb API. I  built it with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, Axios, sessionStorage, and jQuery. And have started another branch to replace jQuery with vanilla JS and Axios with the native JS Fetch Api.

## Motivation

To learn more about and grow my skills in frontend development and working with API's .
